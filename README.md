This was my final project from attending Flatiron School. A family friend has a personal business as an electrician where he hand writes his invoices and is always misplacing customers information. The idea behind this application was to that if he were my technical, it would be something where he could log customers information, invoice customers, even keep track of who has and who hasn't paid him yet. Sometimes he even has other employees that will go to jobs without him, so I wanted there to be more that one employee accessing this information. Some of the features I want to add are a little more out of my scope which is where I would like more expeirence then hopefully come back to this project to clean it up and develop it further.
